 Brief:        Echo the function declaration in                        
               the command line for C/C++, as well                     
               as other languages that ctags                           
               supports.

 Install:      1. Put echofunc.vim to /plugin directory.               
               2. Use the command below to create tags                 
                  file including the language and                      
                  signature fields.                                    
                    ctags -R --fields=+lS .                            
                                                                       
 Usage:        When you type '(' after a function name                 
               in insert mode, the function declaration                
               will be displayed in the command line                   
               automatically. Then you may use Alt+- and               
               Alt+= (configurable via EchoFuncKeyPrev                 
               and EchoFuncKeyNext) to cycle between                   
               function declarations (if exists).                      
                                                                       
               Another feature is to provide a balloon tip             
               when the mouse cursor hovers a function name,           
               macro name, etc. This works with when                   
               +balloon_eval is compiled in.                           
                                                                       
               Because the message line often cleared by               
               some other plugins (e.g. ominicomplete), an             
               other choice is to show message in status line.         
               First, add  %{EchoFuncGetStatusLine()}  to              
               your 'statusline' option.                               
               Second, add the following line to your vimrc            
               let g:EchoFuncShowOnStatus = 1                          
               to avoid echoing function name in message line.         
                                                                       
 Options:      g:EchoFuncLangsDict                                     
                 Dictionary to map the Vim file types to               
                 tags languages that should be used. You do            
                 not need to touch it in most cases.                   
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncLangsUsed                                     
                 File types to enable echofunc, in case you            
                 do not want to use EchoFunc on all file               
                 types supported. Example:                             
                   let g:EchoFuncLangsUsed = ["java","cpp"]            
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncMaxBalloonDeclarations                        
                 Maximum lines to display in balloon declarations.     
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncKeyNext                                       
                 Key to echo the next function.                        
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncKeyPrev                                       
                 Key to echo the previous function.                    
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncShowOnStatus                                  
                 Show function name on status line. NOTE,              
                 you should manually add %{EchoFuncGetStatusLine()}    
                 to your 'statusline' option.                          
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncAutoStartBalloonDeclaration                   
                 Automatically start balloon declaration if not 0.     
                                                                       
               g:EchoFuncPathMappingEnabled                            
               g:EchoFuncPathMapping                                   
                 The new feature added by Zhao Cai provides ability    
                 to shorten file path in some specific directory. e.g. 
                 /home/username/veryveryvery/long/file/path/blabla     
                 could be showed as                                    
                 ~/veryveryvery/long/file/path/blabla                  
                 If you want to disable this feature, add              
                 let g:EchoFuncPathMappingEnabled = 0                  
                 to your vimrc. It's enabled by default.               
                 To add more mappings in g:EchoFuncPathMapping, search 
                 this script and you will know how to do it.
